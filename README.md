# Makery [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kwstannard/makery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kwstannard/makery)

Welcome to Makery. Your [simple, lightweight, opinionated, elegant, minimal](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/65781074112/devils-dictionary-of-programming)
choice for testing factories.

## Installation

```shell
echo "gem 'makery'" >> Gemfile
bundle
```

## Usage

### What kinds of classes can use this?

Any class used needs writer methods corresponding to each attribute and that should be it.

### Defining a factory

Makery tries to avoid DSLs by taking attribute hashes instead.

```ruby
klass = Struct.new(:foo, :bar)

maker = Makery[klass]
maker.base(
  foo: 1
  bar: 2
)
```

#### Using the factory

```ruby
Makery[klass].call.foo == 1 #=> true
```

Makery can use anything that responds to call for delayed execution. There is a
single argument passed for accessing the other attributes. You can also pass
overrides into the call to maker.

```ruby
Makery[klass].call(foo: ->(m) { m[:bar] + 1 }).foo == 3 #=> true
```

Makery uses traits for more complex behavior. Attributes are overrridden by
merging the attribute hashes.

```ruby
maker = Makery[klass]
maker.base(
  foo: 1
  bar: 2
)

maker.trait(
  :big_foo,
  foo: 10
)

Makery[klass].call(:big_foo).foo == 10 #=> true
```

### ActiveRecord

Makery operates independently of ActiveRecord or any ORM.

```ruby
maker = Makery[User]
maker.base(
  email: "email@email.com"
  password: "a password"
)

Makery[User].call.save
```

### Sequences

```ruby
maker = Makery[User]
maker.base(
  email: ->(m) { "email#{m.count}@biz.com" }
)

Makery[User].call.email #=> "email1@biz.com"
Makery[User].call.email #=> "email2@biz.com"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
